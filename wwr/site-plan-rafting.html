        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>We strive to enrich people's lives by providing outstanding adventure experiences. Our goal since 1974 has been to help people of all ages enjoy the best outdoor experience of their lives. We personally encourage and actively support awareness, deeper appreciation and preservation of our natural ecosystems. Our trips are great adventures that emphasize heighten attentiveness to human impact on the environment.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>To anyone is in good health from 6 years old over and who wants to try something new and exciting. To the outdoor sports lovers and to who wants to challenge him-self. To who wants to experience mountains and nature from a different prospective. To who wants to have fun with a bunch of friends. To kids with their parents, to school groups and companies. To who wants to celebrate a bachelor/bachelorette party in an original and adventurous way. What do they want? Focus on the client's entertainment, treat each trip as a unique experience, and make every trip as enjoyable as you can. Make sure that a customer leaves the trip with positive impression. You know the drill: focus foremost on safety, then entertainment. Get customers shouting about how great rafting is to everyone and anyone. What are their needs that aren't being met? Rafting equipment which includes: safety helmet, safety vest and paddle. Depending on the weather conditions, the following are available: long or short neoprene suits, neoprene boots or slippers, waterproof jackets or raincoats. How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)? In year‚Äôs past, the desktop computer was far and away the primary method that people were accessing the Internet. While desktop access is still very big, it is no longer the main device that people use to access the web. Over the past decade, mobile traffic has really shot up, and with smartphones and tablets becoming increasingly popular, the number of people going online through mobile devices is continuing to trend upward.</p>
